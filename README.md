# KcaSniffer (Deprecated)

VpnService-based Common Sniffer Tool for Kancolle Android

About Project
-------
This project is an open-source sniffer to capture request/response packets from Kancolle in Android.  

Since Android system only allows one VpnService, there was a difficulty to use multiple applications which need to get real-time kancolle data. 
So, this project aims to support real-time data to multiple 3rd-party kancolle tools,
and enables other developers to make various kancolle-related applications (like viewers, material logger, etc)
without knowledge of android system or network-related implementation details.

※ This application is under development. The data specification may be different after some updates.  

Requirement
-------
- Android 4.1(JellyBean) or later
- Supporting Android VPN service
- Warning: KcaSniffer may not work for specific devices(vendor-dependent issue) and old devices(Android 4.x).
